# CM3588 NAS Case - Work in Progess!
3D Printable Case for the CM3588 NAS board.  
Minimal Assembly required.

### NOTE:
I do not have the NAS Board on Hand. The printed Case might require some post-processing, or even not fit at all.  
If you decide to print the Case, please leave me some feedback to further improve the Case.  

An early version of the Case is available for download.

## Required Components
- 4 M2 Threaded inserts
- 4 M2 Flat-Head Screws

Any Flat-Head screw is ok. Contersunk screws will damage the PCB, so avoid using these.  
The screw length must be smaller than 10mm.  


## Assembly

1. You need the three Parts of the Case and 5 buttons printed.
2. Begin by inserting the Threaded inserts in the 4 Standoff holes in the Main Body.
3. Place the 5 buttons inside the holes.
4. Insert the CM3588 Board into the Case. Keep it level when inserting. It should go in freely until it hits the standoffs.
5. Secure the PCB with the 4 Screws.
6. Attach the two Panels. The Panels are only using a friction fit currently. This might me improved in later revisions.
7. The NAS is ready to power up.
